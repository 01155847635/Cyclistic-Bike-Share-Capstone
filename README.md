# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Capstone

### Introduction
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, you will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze,share, and act. Along the way, the Case Study Roadmap tables — including guiding questions and key tasks — will help you stay on the right path.
### Scenario
As a data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
Five Steps to do this capstone : ask, prepare, process, analyze,share, and act
### Steps 
#### Ask (Understand the problem)
in this step it necessery to answer some questions to understand the problesm and make dashboard about the data to help decision makerd to make decisions.
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
#### Prepare (Collecting data)
Once there is an understanding of the problem, one can think about how to solve this.Time to decide what data needs to be collected in order to answer the questions and how to organize it so that it is useful.
#### Process (Cleaning data)
A process known as data cleaning is the fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset
#### Analyze (Analysing data)
Next up is to make some conclusions based on the trustable data . Main concept is to think analytically about your data, be critical and be creative. There might be a need to sort and format the data to make it easier to process, make a Pivot table, or create awesome graphs! Remember it is a story that must unfold. 
#### Share (Getting Opinions (dashboard) )
One thing still to remember, whatever we do, we are biased. So as the next step, get additional opinions about the findings. This will significantly help to improve the results and ensure that main aspects were taken into account. As the are many ways to share the finding each person has their preference and so does each company.
#### Act(Solving the problem)
Taken the results and depending on the problem statement, recommendations for further actions can be made. And once the recommendations are ready, the actual decision can be made!
